In Python, the map concept appears as a built-in data type called a dictionary. A dictionary contains key-value pairs. Dictionaries might soon become your favorite data structure in Python—they're extremely easy to use and useful. Here's a sample of setting up a dictionary

udacity = {}
udacity['u'] = 1
udacity['d'] = 2
udacity['a'] = 3
udacity['c'] = 4
udacity['i'] = 5
udacity['t'] = 6
udacity['y'] = 7

print udacity
# {'u': 1, 'd': 2, 'a': 3, 'c': 4, 'i': 5, 't': 6, 'y': 7}
In this case, the letters in "udacity" were each keys in our dictionary, and the position of that letter in the string was the value. Thus, I can do the following:

print udacity['t']
# 6
This statement is saying "go to the key labeled 't' and find it's value, 6".

Dictionaries are wonderfully flexible—you can store a wide variety of structures as values. You store another dictionary or a list:

dictionary = {}
dictionary['d'] = [1]
dictionary['i'] = [2]
dictionary['c'] = [3]
dictionary['t'] = [4]
dictionary['i'].append(5)
dictionary['o'] = [6]
dictionary['n'] = [7]
dictionary['a'] = [8]
dictionary['r'] = [9]
dictionary['y'] = [10]
print udacity
# {'d': [1], 'i': [2, 5], 'c': [3], 't': [4], 'o': [6], 'n': [7], 'a': [8], 'r': [9], 'y':[10]}
You can learn even more about dictionaries in the Python documentation.

"""Time to play with Python dictionaries!
You're going to work on a dictionary that
stores cities by country and continent.
One is done for you - the city of Mountain 
View is in the USA, which is in North America.

You need to add the cities listed below by
modifying the structure.
Then, you should print out the values specified
by looking them up in the structure.

Cities to add:
Bangalore (India, Asia)
Atlanta (USA, North America)
Cairo (Egypt, Africa)
Shanghai (China, Asia)"""

"""Print the following (using "print").
1. A list of all cities in the USA in
alphabetic order.
2. All cities in Asia, in alphabetic
order, next to the name of the country.
In your output, label each answer with a number
so it looks like this:
1
American City
American City
2
Asian City - Country
Asian City - Country"""

When we're talking about hash tables, we can define a "load factor":

Load Factor = Number of Entries / Number of Buckets
The purpose of a load factor is to give us a sense of how "full" a hash table is. For example, if we're trying to store 10 values in a hash table with 1000 buckets, the load factor would be 0.01, and the majority of buckets in the table will be empty. We end up wasting memory by having so many empty buckets, so we may want to rehash, or come up with a new hash function with less buckets. We can use our load factor as an indicator for when to rehash—as the load factor approaches 0, the more empty, or sparse, our hash table is.

On the flip side, the closer our load factor is to 1 (meaning the number of values equals the number of buckets), the better it would be for us to rehash and add more buckets. Any table with a load value greater than 1 is guaranteed to have collisions.

"""
In this quiz, you'll write your own hash table and hash function that uses string keys. Your table will store strings in buckets by their first two letters, according to the formula below:

Hash Value = (ASCII Value of First Letter * 100) + ASCII Value of Second Letter 
You can assume that the string will have at least two letters, and the first two characters are uppercase letters (ASCII values from 65 to 90). You can use the Python function ord() to get the ASCII value of a letter, and chr() to get the letter associated with an ASCII value.

You'll create a HashTable class, methods to store and lookup values, and a helper function to calculate a hash value given a string. You cannot use a Python dictionary—only lists! And remember to store lists at each bucket, and not just the string itself. For example, you can store "UDACITY" at index 8568 as ["UDACITY"].
